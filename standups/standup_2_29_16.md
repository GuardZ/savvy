## Progress this period
- Merged two pull requests with our master branch; one handles data generation, cleaning, and processing and the other adds plotting functionality.
- Created a main driver notebook for our program that interacts with all our modules.
- Updated plotting function to now incorporate Bokeh tools (hover tool, save, resize, reset).
- Added option to plot on log or linear axis, stacked or separate bars, display X number of values

## Deliverables for next period
- Merge the outstanding pull request with master.
- Add option to create different plot if # of parameters drops below certain number (Histogram?)
- Incorporate 2nd order information through Bokeh tools (format yet to be determined)
- Continue to expand functionality of data processing module with a few of our "wish list" functions.

## Challenges to make next deliverables
### Team issues:
- Have yet to merge all of our branches back to master because final branch to be merged was dependent on the other two pull requests, and changes in those branches require significant revisions to the remaining branch. 

### Tech uncertainties and blockers
- None so far with regards to plotting in Bokeh
- Getting a large 2nd order data set by end of quarter (have started this analysis but it cold take several weeks)
- Connecting plot glyphs graphically via 2nd order data (Still need to decide on method and implement)

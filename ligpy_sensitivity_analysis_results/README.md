This folder contains the full sensitivity analysis results from our lignin pyrolysis model (available at https://github.com/houghb/ligpy).  These files are not needed to use savvy on your own data, and the sample files included in the savvy package are a subset of this dataset, but we included them here so that readers who are interested in our kinetic scheme for lignin pyrolysis can explore the sensitivity of the model to its inputs.

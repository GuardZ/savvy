Introduction
============
Do you savvy your sensitivity analysis results? savvy is a data visualization
toolkit that provides interactive visualizations of the results from high
dimensionality global sensitivity analyses. Users can visualize Sobol
sensitivity analysis results generated by
`SALib <https://github.com/SALib/SALib>`_, or any data with the same
structure as the standard SALib output from a Sobol analysis.

savvy was written to visualize the total, first order, and second order
sensitivities of 30 outputs from a lignin pyrolysis model with 410 parameters
Consequently, some functionality is specific to our model and is noted as such
in relevant docstrings, but overriding the default arguments in these
functions allows users to use any SALib output data from SALib.analyze.sobol.

Package Structure
=================
savvy is organized as follows, where blue rectangles are savvy modules, green
diamonds are input or output files, and the red rectangle is any black-box
model of your choice that can take a set of inputs and produce outputs you
would like to analyze.

Do you savvy your sensitivity analysis results?  savvy is a data visualization toolkit that provides interactive visualizations of the results from high dimensionality global sensitivity analyses.  Users can visualize Sobol sensitivity analysis results generated by SALib (https://github.com/SALib/SALib), or any data with the same structure (described in the documentation).  

savvy was written to visualize the total, first order, and second order sensitivities of 30 outputs from a lignin pyrolysis model with 410 parameters *(link to the lignin pyrolysis model will be added when that project is published)*.  Consequently, some functionality is specific to our model and is noted as such in relevant docstrings, but overriding the default arguments in these functions allows users to use any SALib output data from SALib.analyze.sobol.

### Quick Start
For the quickest introduction to savvy, run the file `savvy_driver.ipynb` in
a Jupyter notebook.

Alternatively, install savvy using setup.py (see the documentation for
details), then run the following in a Jupyter notebook.  The Jupyter
notebook is required for interactive widgets to work.
```python
import copy

from bokeh.plotting import show, output_notebook
import os.path as op

import savvy
import savvy.data_processing as dp
import savvy.interactive_plots as ip
from savvy.plotting import make_plot, make_second_order_heatmap
import savvy.network_tools as nt

output_notebook()

# path to sample data files
path = op.join(savvy.__path__[0], 'sample_data_files/')

# store all of the data files into a dictionary
sa_dict = dp.get_sa_data(path)

# create interactive radial plots (or bar charts)
ip.interact_with_plot_all_outputs(sa_dict)

# Plot the second order plots with tabs for all the options
ip.plot_all_second_order(sa_dict, top=5, mirror=True)


# Network plot of the second order interactions
# and first/total order indices
# (set inline to false for an interactive window)
sa_dict_net = copy.deepcopy(sa_dict)
g = nt.build_graph(sa_dict_net['sample-output1'], sens='ST', top=40,
                   min_sens=0.01, edge_cutoff=0.0)
nt.plot_network_circle(g, inline=True)
```

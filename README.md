### High Dimensionality Sensitivity Analysis visualization toolkit (savvy)                               
----
savvy is a data visualization toolkit that provides interactive visualizations of the results from global sensitivity analyses.  Users can visualize Sobol sensitivity analysis results generated by SALib (https://github.com/SALib/SALib), or any data with the same structure (described in the documentation).  

savvy was written to visualize the total, first order, and second order sensitivities of 30 outputs from a lignin pyrolysis model with 410 parameters *(link to the lignin pyrolysis model will be added soon - when that project is published)*.  Consequently, some functionality is specific to our model and is noted as such in relevant docstrings.

### Summary of Folder Contents

**[doc](https://github.com/houghb/savvy/tree/master/doc)** - To be completed.  This folder will contain the project documentation.

**[savvy](https://github.com/houghb/savvy/tree/master/savvy)** - Houses the driver and modules to visualize the sensitivity analysis results.  Use the functions in `sensitivity_tools.py` to carry out a sensitivity analysis on your own model using SALib.  Once you've run your analysis, the functions in `data_processing.py` will read and clean up your results so they can be visualized with plots described in `plotting.py`.

**[savvy/tests](https://github.com/houghb/savvy/tree/master/savvy/tests)** - Unit tests for the savvy modules.

**[standups](https://github.com/houghb/savvy/tree/master/standups)** - Notes from short standup meetings to discuss our progress building this package.
